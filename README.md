- ### 1NF:
    - âœ” Each table has its own `primary key`

    - âœ” There is no '`atomic`'(indivisible) value

- ### 2NF:
    - âœ”Follows 1NF.

    - âœ”There is no partial `depencies`(no `primary key` determines some other attributes.)

- ### 3NF:
    - âœ”Follows 3NF.

    - âœ”There is no transitive `depencies`(no non-key attribute determines some other attribute).

- ### 4NF:
    - âœ” Follows 4NF.

    - âœ” No multi-valued `depencies`.

Since these all the four Normalisation are followed by our table,the table is in the normalisation form.
